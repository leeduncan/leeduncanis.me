#leeduncanis.me

Personal website of Lee Duncan, used as a place to put my links and keep an updated CV ready to go, because I hate LinkedIn.

It's a static site hosted in AWS S3, built in Python using Flask (and Frozen Flask). IT also uses Markdown files to manage the content, which is rendered into HTML with the markdown2 library. This just means I can update the content easily without having to write fiddly bits of HTML.
