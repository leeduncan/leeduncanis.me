Hello. I am Lee, and I am a Data Architect working for IOP Publishing, living in [Bristol](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bristol/@51.4734427,-2.627948,11.75z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4871836681b3d861:0x8ee4b22e4b9ad71f!8m2!3d51.454513!4d-2.58791!16zL20vMDk1bDA?entry=ttu). I enjoy playing football for [Evergreen AFC](https://twitter.com/EvergreenAFC), supporting **[üçí AFC Bournemouth üçí](https://www.afcb.co.uk/)** and reading about football tactics. I *love* the band [Soundgarden](https://soundgardenworld.com/).
